# openui5-demo
Demo site for the Jekyll theme jekyll-openui5

You might be wondering, why I bent the output from `_site` to `docs`. This way, I can use the github pages functionality of this repo as a demo site. I just have to build and push and after a minute or two, the latest version is there as a working demo site.
